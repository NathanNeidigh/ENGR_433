# Problem Statement
The logic analyzer developed by Gusman and forked by Dr. Frohne utilizes the pico2-ice development board; however, this software lacks tests that generate signal patterns for complex trigger testing. Accordinly, this project will create a testing suite that tests for the following triggering scenarios.

- Sequential triggers
- Combinational triggers
- Time-based triggers
- Edge-triggered sequences

## Sequentail Trigger
## Combinational Trigger
## Time-Based Trigger
## Edge-Triggered Sequences
